# Live Art

#### A web application using web monetization and socket.io to enable supporters to view live art and make micro payments to the artist.

Please visit the hosted site [here]

If you are an artist you will need a payment pointer to enable micro payments to be made to your web wallet. Uphold offer a good service for this and you can sign up[here](https://uphold.com/en-gb/)
