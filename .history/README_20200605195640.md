Please visit the hosted site [here]

If you are an artist you will need a payment pointer to enable micro payments to be made to your web wallet. Uphold offer a good service for this and you can sign up [here](https://uphold.com/en-gb/)

As a supporter you will need an coil account and the relevant extention for your web browser. All can be found [here](https://coil.com/)

Once logged in and the site is monetized, the artist will be able to draw on the canvas with the supporter able to view in real time.
